# LAN Cache in a docker container

Simply expose this container on port 80, and point a bunch of domains to this server's IP address, 
and you get a fully operational LAN cache. Hooray!

To build and run, do:
```
./buildcontainer.sh
./start.sh
```

`start.sh` will make a /data/ directory to store logs and cache data in. 

*Warning*: some services (eg, when downloading the Origin client) require HTTPS access to the 
hosts that we are hijacking. To avoid connectivity issues, you will need to run an 
[SNI proxy](https://github.com/dlundquist/sniproxy) to enable pass through of HTTPS traffic. 

You can build and run the sniproxy container in the `sniproxy` directory to achieve this. 

```
cd sniproxy
docker build -t sniproxy .
docker run --name sniproxy -p 443:443 sniproxy
```

### Super Quick Start
```
# Start with a clean install of linux, and make sure `/data` is on a volume with plent of disk space.

# Install Docker if you need it - curl sudo bash is terrible, but you're trusting my code anyway :)
curl -sSL https://get.docker.com | sudo bash

# Get this repo
git clone https://github.com/OpenSourceLAN/origin-docker.git
cd origin-docker

# Set your max cache size
# Edit nginx.conf. Find the proxy_cache_path line and udpate the max_size parameter to the maximum
# amount of disk space you would like your cache to use

# Build the containers
./buildcontainer.sh

# Start the cache container (note: uses `--restart=always`, so will auto-start after reboot)
./start.sh

# Start the SNI proxy container (optional, but recommended)
docker run --name sniproxy -p 443:443 sniproxy

# Start the DNS server if you need it
(cd dnsmasq && ./start.sh)
```
